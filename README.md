# compiler

A compiler for a version of pascal language. 
This project was developed as an answer to a course's project, part of my bachelor's degree courses.
Many things may be missing, I am not interested in that project, and while I was developing it, 
I did not know much about git (almost nothing). So if you only want to have a look on how a compiler may be 
developed you are welcome to look through this project.
